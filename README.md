# webportfolio

Working on my own web portfolio that showcases my past software projects that I built.
Utilized a free HTML/CSS/JS template from MashUp and utilized free photos from Unsplash and my personal profile picture.
Customized the free template to my own needs to showcase some of my coding projects and my personal background.

Server code is written in Python (Flask web framework).
